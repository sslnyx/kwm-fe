        question: "What is a Multiplex?",
        answer: "A multiplex is a residential building that typically includes two to six individual homes on a single lot, offering a smart blend of privacy, flexibility, and efficient land use. Designed for a range of lifestyles, from young families to rightsizing seniors, multiplex homes provide adaptable living options without sacrificing comfort. With modern layouts, thoughtful design and energy-saving features, they support sustainable, future-ready urban living.",
    },
    {
        question: "Benefits of Multiplex Living",
        answer: "Multiplex homes are typically non-strata, meaning homeowners fully own both their unit and the land with no strata fees, no bylaws and no unnecessary restrictions. This gives owners greater control over their property, from landscaping choices to long-term upgrades and renovations. Full land ownership also supports stronger investment potential and future flexibility. For those seeking independence and lasting value, multiplex living offers a more practical, empowering alternative to traditional townhomes.",
        defaultOpen: true,
    },
    {
        question: "Where Can Multiplex Homes be Located?",
        answer: "Multiplex homes are now permitted citywide across many areas that were previously single-detached–only zones. Under Vancouver's new R1-1 Residential Inclusive Zone, which consolidates multiple low-density zones, multiplex development is now allowed on a wide range of lots throughout the city.",
    },
    {
        question: "How Long is the Construction Process?",
        answer: "The design and permit phase typically takes 6 to 12 months, followed by 12 to 18 months of construction, resulting in a total timeline of approximately 18 to 30 months.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is the Minimum Lot Size for a Multiplex Home?",
        answer: `Not every property is suitable for multiplex development, so it's important to confirm whether your lot meets municipal requirements. Eligibility depends on factors such as lot size, width, access and environmental conditions.

<strong>Zoning Regulations – Unit Count by Lot Size</strong>
• 3–4 units: minimum lot size ~3,294 sq ft
• 5 units: minimum lot size ~4,994 sq ft
• 6 units: minimum lot size ~5,995 sq ft

<strong>Site Requirements – Lot Width</strong>
• Up to 4 units: minimum 32.8 ft
• 5 units: minimum 44 ft
• 6 units: minimum 50 ft

<strong>Access</strong>
• Street Frontage: Required for all multiplex lots
• Rear Access: Must have a laneway`,
